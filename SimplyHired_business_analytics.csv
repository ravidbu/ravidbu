We serve US and Global Fortune 500 clients through five practices: Strategy, M&A Due Diligence, Sources of Growth, Corporate Finance, and Organizational Performance. Since our founding in 2004, we’ve worked on the ground in 89 countries and have developed a particular expertise in emerging markets across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. We work to solve some of the toughest problems in business and unlock superior value for our clients through our scientific approach to problem-solving, passion for complex projects, and one-world mindset.

The Canback difference:
Small firm with a global focus: Canback consultants enjoy unparalleled access to senior members of the firm as well as client C-suite executives, even as junior consultants. Additionally, our staffing model maximizes consultants’ time spent at their home office, enabling a tight-knit and casual office culture while still providing opportunities for domestic and international travel to gain a first-hand understanding of markets and consumers.
Responsibilities and upward mobility: Canback consultants are full team members on day one and typically own larger pieces of client work faster than the norm at peer consulting firms. Our consultants also participate in various internal committees overseeing functions such as recruitment, technology management, or social media. Given the high level of visibility across Canback, superior performers are appropriately recognized and can progress quickly through our established career ladder.
Partnership based strategy consulting: We engage with clients to solve high-impact strategic problems within the broader context of the organization’s goals. This approach of building long-term client partnerships enables Canback consultants to develop in-depth institutional knowledge and observe, over time, the impact of their work on client organizations.

Projects typically last for 2-4 months and are run by Engagement Managers leading teams of 3-5. Often, your work will be focused on consumer-facing products and services that you may regularly interact with in daily life.

Some responsibilities of Canback BAs include:
Analyzing market and client data in Excel to distill insights (e.g. competitive analysis, pricing performance, product-line profitability)
Building statistical models on STATA/R/Python (e.g. price elasticities, demand forecasting, geospatial analysis)
Conducting secondary research, typically by combining information from a variety of sources (e.g. annual reports, news articles, industry reports)
Creating presentations that integrate qualitative knowledge with numerical evidence and provide actionable recommendations
Participating in client meetings and updates and interfacing with junior client team members
Accompanying project teams on market visits within the US and abroad

A demonstrated aptitude for quantitative analysis and the willingness to learn advanced analytic methods
Ability to work independently while contributing effectively to the overall project objectives
Strong interpersonal and communication skills
Interest in emerging markets and foreign cultures, and proficiency in a second language are a plus, as is basic familiarity with a statistical software like STATA/R/Python

Our most successful consultants have exceptional analytical skills, a knack for problem solving, and a creative, inquisitive mind. They’re also entrepreneurial and take initiatives to contribute to the firm beyond core client deliverables.

Excellent oral and written communication skills

Why Clarity Insights, Why Consulting and Why Now?
We don’t try to be everything to everybody all the time. We specialize in Data & Analytics and will remain a platform and tool agnostic company so you can grow technically throughout your career. It sounds ridiculous but you actually need to be 100% technical and 100% business with strategy because we don’t hire non-communicative robots who have a one size fits all approach. We often could speak to a CFO or Head of Underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline – in terms they can understand – why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. If we step across to the DevOps lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about Apache committers, OSF, full stack development, microservices, containers – you know – GEEK OUT. We’re not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun together. Most people join here and stay here for the people. That said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles. I have a million things to share about why that may change and why that must stay the same for now, but here’s a suggestion – if you LOVE Cloud Computing for Big Data and/or Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning, etc we should talk.

NOTE: We are only considering candidates interested in full-time employment who do not require Visa Sponsorship or transfers now or in the future.

We recognize that our competitive advantage starts with our people and our culture. At Aperio, we work hard and move quickly as a well-coordinated, collaborative team whose exceptional people are focused on providing extraordinary client service. Our firm seeks to build a workforce that is as diverse in experience, perspective, and culture as the clients with whom we aspire to work.

Our headquarters is in Sausalito, California, only one block from the beautiful harbor. It’s a short, 20-minute drive from much of San Francisco (opposite the normal commute), and many of our team members are spread throughout San Francisco, the North Bay, and East Bay. If you are looking for an opportunity to grow and contribute in a fun, industry-disruptive, fast-paced environment, Aperio is the place for you.

APERIO GROUP, LLC IS COMMITTED TO ATTRACTING, RETAINING, ENGAGING, AND DEVELOPING A POOL OF TALENT THAT IS DIVERSE ALONG MANY DIMENSIONS. WE SEEK TO LEVERAGE THESE DIVERSE EXPERIENCES, BACKGROUNDS, AND VIEWPOINTS TO BEST SERVE THE NEEDS OF OUR CLIENTS.

Position Description

Within our ESG work, Aperio manages more than $8B in 1,100 SMAs (separately managed accounts), each customized to meet individual client social profiles. Aperio works with our industry’s leading wealth managers, investment consultants, private banks, and large broker/dealer teams to serve ultra-high-net-worth families, single-family offices, and endowments and foundations.

Aperio’s ESG/SRI team works collaboratively with advisors and their clients to help them translate their values, missions, and/or ESG perspectives into unique client social profiles that our portfolio management team then uses to construct quantitative, passively managed equity portfolios. The ESG/SRI team has developed a unique and deep understanding of ESG data, the ESG industry, thematic issues, and values-oriented clients. This understanding is coupled with an expertise in partnering with our portfolio management and tax economics team to ensure that the social profile is implemented with the appropriate balance regarding risk, taxes, and other investment parameters that are important to the client. The team strives to build the optimal strategy for each client that reflects the appropriate trade-offs among their values, preferred portfolio risk, and taxes. Our focus is on constructing custom strategies that best meet the client’s needs; we work with clients on both sides of issues and approach all values sets with the same respect and rigor. We are agnostic to value sets and to whether ESG drives alpha – we leave the decision on what matters and why to our clients. Our focus is on the best most thoughtful reflection of our client’s values and mission.

Aperio values alignment has always been integrated into the fabric of Aperio—another tool in our customization tool box to enable us to respond thoughtfully and deeply to evolving client needs. Our team is called upon to provide expertise for portfolio management, research, and business development behind the scenes and directly with clients. The ESG/SRI team manages ESG data relationships; reviews and develops expertise in ESG data sets, proxy voting, and shareholder engagement; develops new customization options for general and mandate-specific uses; and develops materials, research, and resources for internal and external use.

Position Summary:
Do you want to work directly with hospital and health system clients? Interact with executives, physican leaders, and operational staff? Have you wanted to discover new insights by combining data from EMR/EHR, claims, consumer/retail, devices, and wearables? Are you excited about deploying analytically-derived insights into the clinical and operational workflow? Do you like working with smart and motivated people? If so, you’ve come to the right place!

We are looking for a person who said “YES!!” to all of those questions to join our team. We work directly with hospitals and health systems to solve their technical and analytical challenges as they move from “volume to value”. These challenges range from needing to understand the root causes of clinical and cost savings opportunities, to quickly building and deploying predictive analytics to identify patients with high risk of an emergency hospitalization readmissions – and since the best analytics in the world do nothing on their own, we do our work and embed it into clinical and operational workflow.

Job Description:
Role and Responsibilities:
If you were to be in this role, your primary responsibility would be to do projects that lead to improvement in health and financial outcomes and do work to support clients. Tactically speaking, this means performing the work outlined in the SOW, and partner with the team on leading the client through the process and communicating results. More broadly, to do this, you would understand the mutual goals and value based contracts, conduct assemble information and perform analyses to quantify baseline performance, identify opportunities and the root causes for them, and collaborate with the client and our operations staff to achieve our goals.

More specifically, your job would be to:
Understand the client’s business goals well-enough to ensure the SOW will meet their needs
Lead the discovery of the client’s EMR/EHR and/or claims data environment so we can efficiently and effectively navigate and do the analyses
Lead the analytical-interrogation of their EMR/EHR and/or claims data to perform data quality checks
Partner with our biostatisticians and data scientists to perform the analyses and displays
Communicate results/findings with the client and identify implications and recommend actions

In this role, you’d also have responsibility to take on new challenges. For example, today the EMR/EHR data we’re working with for one client doesn’t include real-time data streams, but over the next few months we will have access to streams that are real-time and need you to partner with our technology partners to intake, analyze, and output that so that it is maximally actionable by our client. Examples of the data streams include those from 3rd parties such as from clinical assessments, in-hospital monitors (for example, levels of blood carbon dioxide), home monitors (for example, weight scales for patients with heart failure), and wearables (for example physical activity and heart rate from FitBit type devices).

Experience, Qualifications and Education:
The skills, knowledge, and attributes we’re looking for are listed below:

Attitude : A generally positive demeanor and outlook, works well with others and is community-minded, has a proactive leadership orientation, and enjoys contributing through work
Healthcare Domain Knowledge : Conceptual understanding of how hospitals and systems work, how they’re paid by commercial carriers and the government, and how changing reimbursement is necessitating that hospitals and health systems be able to identify and manage risk; be able to decipher the healthcare-alphabet-soup that includes ACA, ACO, AMA, BMI, CMS, through to HIE and HIPAA, etc.
Healthcare Data Expertise : Current “hands-on” working knowledge of healthcare data, including data from EMR/EHR and/or from medical and pharmacy administrative claims; strong preference will be given to those with expertise from working with claims data from multiple lines of business and payers.
Social Determinants of Health (SDH) Expertise: Also, current “hands-on” knowledge of seeking out new sources of socioeconomic, public record, biometric, and retail/consumer data, including acquisition of new SDH sources.
Analytical Actions : Logical and systematic approach to problem solving, with the ability to visualize, articulate, and solve complex problems and concepts, make decisions, and take appropriate action
Multi-Faceted : Track record in charting untested waters; need to possess conceptual skills to learn new technologies, and contribute to areas such as infrastructure, administration, and project management with ease
Handy with Tools : Working knowledge of database and analytic tools including SQL and SAS (or, equivalents)
Data Model Knowledge : Have a deep enough understanding of data model approaches to be able to discuss the pros/cons of each with our clients and data architects and create business requirements
Technical Leadership : Experience in conceptualizing analytic projects end-to-end and ability to guide other analysts with detailed reviews of their work and providing overall technical leadership
Value Orientation : Ability to constantly calibrate activities to ensure effort is focused on value and not solely on technical activities, cost, and schedules

Minimum Resume Requirements:
5+ years of experience in healthcare data analysis (including EMR/EHR, claims, eligibility and publicly available data such as CMS LDS)
Experience “managing up” – managing client expectations, for example, “under-promising and over-delivering”
Utilization of analytical tools including SQL, SAS, SPSS, and/or open-source including Python and R, or similar
Familiarity with HEDIS & CMS care quality measures; experience implementing both HEDIS and CMS measures using SAS and/or SQL

Intern, Analytics, Data Science - 20000256

For Us, It's A Mission
At Mylan, we mean it when we say we work every day to provide access to high quality medicines to the world's 7 billion people. If you are unconventional, relentless and passionate. If you believe in doing what's right, not what's easy. If you are a doer and have a passion for serving others, we want to talk to you.

Make a Difference
At Mylan, each person has the ability to make a difference. From the providers who sell and market our products, to the producers who develop and manufacture them and finally to our business partners who support the providers and producers, we all have a mission critical role. Here's how this role will help:
The analytics team is responsible for the data science capability at Mylan. A typical day for the data scientist team focuses on leveraging vast amounts of data by applying machine learning, artificial intelligence, advanced process automation, and advanced analytics research. In this capacity, our data scientists work across the enterprise and with our business partners to help drive results and identify opportunities within advanced analytics. A successful data scientist intern will be part scientist, part strategist, part engineer and part artist.
Work with the Latest Technologies: You will work with a team of data scientists working on machine learning algorithms and mathematical models on the Azure platform. You will also get a chance to work on some of the latest technologies in the data science field such as Hadoop, Spark, HBase, Stream Analytics, Cognitive Services, Data Lake Analytics, Data lake Store, U-SQL, Cosmos DB along with tools like Alteryx and Tableau.
Develop and Enhance Data Science Skill Sets: You should be comfortable developing algorithms, mathematical models and cognitive capabilities that interact with other software and analytical components that run autonomously with minimal human supervision. We expect you to have a solid foundation developing Machine Learning algorithms and Data Science models which to build upon over the course of the internship.
Build Strong Partnerships: We are striving to integrate advanced analytics into our everyday culture. You will be asked to work with the business / domain experts to understand what they want to solve. Then, apply data science capabilities to help us overcome the hardest challenges, breakdown the data silos, connect the disparate parts and champion the data-driven culture.
The Art of Data Science: You can be the best data scientist, but if you cannot communicate your research no one may ever know. Data storytelling will be part of your internship experience. You should expect to assemble the data science tools and models and apply them to data to answer the relevant questions – and communicate that answer in a way a non-data scientist will understand. A proactive, creative, curious mind-set and a desire to influence your own development will go a long way.
Data Science Internship Responsibilities
Identify the data and advanced analytics needs to address the project challenges, define the appropriate solution and deploy the advanced analytics models to deliver results
Drive the collection of new data and the refinement of existing data sources
Explore the data to drive value where value has yet to be realized

CentralReach was developed for Clinicians by Clinicians. The story of CentralReach begins at an ABA clinic based out of Pompano Beach, Florida. The company’s founder, a practicing Board Certified Behavioral Analyst, was drowning in manual management of her clinic from scheduling staff and filing claims to reporting on clinical data. She decided that there had to be a better way to manage her operations so she could spend more time on what mattered most — working with her clients and patients. To help ABA practices focus on what they do best, CentralReach launched the first iteration of its EHR and practice management platform in 2012.

Today, under the leadership of Chris Sullens, an award-winning CEO in the technology space, CentralReach is committed to their mission of providing cutting-edge technology and services to help clinicians and educators produce superior client and patient outcomes. Already a market leader, CentralReach is expected to grow exponentially through its four core tenets: hire and develop great people; build industry-leading products; provide exceptional service to customers and continuously invest in systems, processes and infrastructure.

CentralReach was developed for Clinicians by Clinicians. The story of CentralReach begins at an ABA clinic based out of Pompano Beach, Florida. The company’s founder, a practicing Board Certified Behavioral Analyst, was drowning in manual management of her clinic from scheduling staff and filing claims to reporting on clinical data. She decided that there had to be a better way to manage her operations so she could spend more time on what mattered most — working with her clients and patients. To help ABA practices focus on what they do best, CentralReach launched the first iteration of its EHR and practice management platform in 2012.

From the humblest NYC slice and a cup of joe to museum-quality lattes (and, yes, avocado toast), each order represents a long paper trail and a series of truck deliveries.

At Cheetah, a relentless executive team has set out to change this reality, armed with deep industry and entrepreneurial experience, personal conviction, and $70M in funding from Eclipse, Floodgate, and the early backers of Facebook, Lyft and Airbnb.

With footholds in several major American urban centers, Cheetah is already streamlining the daily workflow of hundreds of restaurants and small business owners. Using Cheetah's services, they manage millions of dollars in monthly purchasing, while Cheetah eliminates the burden of costly sales reps and inflexible, inefficient distribution centers. Partnering with the largest wholesale suppliers in the US, Cheetah is bringing Silicon Valley user experience and data-driven insight to a space that hadn’t changed much in decades. In the process, we're helping to reintroduce the small business owner to the small farmer, global supply chains to familiar faces; and delivery and logistics workers to increased mobility and new opportunities.

Operating smack in the middle of supply and demand, Cheetah has introduced unprecedented transparency in pricing and inventory to the SMB marketplace. In doing so, Cheetah allows the people who form the backbone of local economies to focus on what they love: cooking great food and providing excellent service. From the convenience of their phones, business owners can now order whatever they need, discover new, rare or seasonal specialty products, and prioritize their customers. No more rushing to unload your double-parked van, or waiting anxiously for a truck to show up with your weekly allotment of boxes.

As a Pricing Analyst, you’ll play a critical role in defining and executing our pricing strategy. Your most significant responsibility will be owning and driving the company’s pricing process. You will execute the strategy and analyze the impact of prices and costs. Additionally, you will identify new opportunities, evaluate existing models, and implement new strategies.

1142,"Restaurants and small businesses account for hundreds of billions of dollars in annual purchasing, yet most of it happens offline. From the humblest NYC slice and a cup of joe to museum-quality lattes (and, yes, avocado toast), each order represents a long paper trail and a series of truck deliveries.

At Cheetah, a relentless executive team has set out to change this reality, armed with deep industry and entrepreneurial experience, personal conviction, and $70M in funding from Eclipse, Floodgate, and the early backers of Facebook, Lyft and Airbnb.

With footholds in several major American urban centers, Cheetah is already streamlining the daily workflow of hundreds of restaurants and small business owners. Using Cheetah's services, they manage millions of dollars in monthly purchasing, while Cheetah eliminates the burden of costly sales reps and inflexible, inefficient distribution centers. Partnering with the largest wholesale suppliers in the US, Cheetah is bringing Silicon Valley user experience and data-driven insight to a space that hadn’t changed much in decades. In the process, we're helping to reintroduce the small business owner to the small farmer, global supply chains to familiar faces; and delivery and logistics workers to increased mobility and new opportunities.

Operating smack in the middle of supply and demand, Cheetah has introduced unprecedented transparency in pricing and inventory to the SMB marketplace. In doing so, Cheetah allows the people who form the backbone of local economies to focus on what they love: cooking great food and providing excellent service. From the convenience of their phones, business owners can now order whatever they need, discover new, rare or seasonal specialty products, and prioritize their customers. No more rushing to unload your double-parked van, or waiting anxiously for a truck to show up with your weekly allotment of boxes.

We're looking for a Product Manager to be the driving force behind the product strategy, design, implementation, and release of key company initiatives that serve our rapidly growing customer base. At Cheetah, product managers work hand in hand with all parts of the business – and most importantly – our customers. You'll be joining an experienced team of product managers, designers, and engineers who develop large scale business and product features that have a direct impact on Cheetah's growth. On a day to day basis, you'll be meeting with customers, operations personnel, key internal stakeholders, and leadership to develop and drive the strategy for products that are core to the Cheetah experience. We are looking for a technical and driven team player who wants to grow and scale Cheetah to a category-leading product.
