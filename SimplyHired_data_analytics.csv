0,"Imagine a typical day at the office that entails interviewing subjects, testifying in court and advising on all matters related to our national security. If those collective roles make up a career you wish to pursue, consider applying to the FBI. Our Special Agents seek out cyberthieves, infiltrate organized crime rings and oversee terrorism investigations, often training local, state and foreign counterparts on the latest technologies in intelligence gathering and data analysis. Of course, our ultimate mission is to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States.While individuals of all backgrounds are highly encouraged to apply to be an FBI Special Agent, we’re specifically seeking individuals with the following skills:SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING AND MATH (STEM): Your STEM background could significantly contribute to our work in keeping up with evolving threats and aggressive actions taken against our national security. We need Special Agents who are logical thinkers and experienced in network security, computer science, software engineering, mathematical formulation and technology. Because technology permeates every aspect of what we do, counterterrorism investigations, as well as technology and computer-based cybercrimes (website hacks, intrusions, data theft, ransomware and other attacks) make up some of our top priorities.LINGUISTS: You may have been raised speaking a language other than English, taught it for a few years or even participated in intensive learning before going overseas to use it. You know that your language skills can make a difference, whether your specialty is Arabic, Bosnian, Chinese, Farsi, Russian, Spanish, Somali, Uzbek, Korean, Portuguese or another foreign language.LAW/LEGAL: By applying your legal knowledge to our casework, you will be instrumental in helping investigate criminal activities and identifying authorities and other entities to further investigations.

Whether you have detective, SWAT, helicopter/jet/rescue pilot, K-9 handler, bomb tech, operational paramedic experience or otherwise, you raise challenging questions on a daily basis and, because of that, you recognize that the FBI is the next step for you.EDUCATION/TEACHING: Whether you’re a college or university professor (tenured, adjunct or otherwise), a faculty member or an elementary, middle or high school teacher, you have a gift for relating with individuals of all ages and backgrounds. Your teaching skills make you methodical and you can consolidate comprehensive information into strategic, analytical lesson plans. Your skills will easily translate to a Special Agent career, where you’ll enhance your team’s understanding of threats, vulnerabilities and gaps by investigating matters and building relationships with communities and individuals from all walks of life.CYBERSECURITY/TECHNOLOGY: Whether you work in counterterrorism, criminal investigations or thwarting cyberattacks, investigating computer-based crimes (website hacks, intrusions, data theft, ransomware, etc.)make up some of our top priorities. You will work on highly collaborative investigative teams to thwart counterintelligence plots, fraud, bank robberies and more. You can expect continued specialized training once onboard and opportunities to work on some of the Bureau’s most complex cases.HEALTHCARE SERVICES/MEDICAL: Special Agent Paramedics, Occupational Health Nurses, Employee Assistance Counselors and Mental Health Assessment Specialists possess unique knowledge, skills and experiences that are highly valued by the FBI. Our professionals use their medical training and experience to work in settings throughout all FBI operations — both in the office, as well as in the field — to protect the American people. Whatever your specialty, there’s a good chance that you may be embedded within certain field SWAT teams, our Hazardous Materials Response Unit (HMRU) in the FBI Lab and our Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) in our Critical Incident Response Group (CIRG).PSYCHOLOGY/COUNSELING: Your understanding of human behavior is critical in analyzing motives and providing insights about psychological characteristics and behavioral patterns that help keep people safe. Your analysis helps assess threats and identify individuals and groups who may pose risks to national security or public safety. Your expertise and compassion ensure the most appropriate and effective handling of sensitive cases involving children or trauma victims and situations, including hostage negotiations.ACCOUNTING/FINANCE: You are driven to follow the money trail and discover hidden assets, connecting the dots to trace transactions back to their source.

For Us, It's A Mission
At Mylan, we mean it when we say we work every day to provide access to high quality medicines to the world's 7 billion people. If you are unconventional, relentless and passionate. If you believe in doing what's right, not what's easy. If you are a doer and have a passion for serving others, we want to talk to you.

Make a Difference
At Mylan, each person has the ability to make a difference. From the providers who sell and market our products, to the producers who develop and manufacture them and finally to our business partners who support the providers and producers, we all have a mission critical role. Here's how this role will help:
The analytics team is responsible for the data science capability at Mylan. A typical day for the data scientist team focuses on leveraging vast amounts of data by applying machine learning, artificial intelligence, advanced process automation, and advanced analytics research. In this capacity, our data scientists work across the enterprise and with our business partners to help drive results and identify opportunities within advanced analytics. A successful data scientist intern will be part scientist, part strategist, part engineer and part artist.
Work with the Latest Technologies: You will work with a team of data scientists working on machine learning algorithms and mathematical models on the Azure platform. You will also get a chance to work on some of the latest technologies in the data science field such as Hadoop, Spark, HBase, Stream Analytics, Cognitive Services, Data Lake Analytics, Data lake Store, U-SQL, Cosmos DB along with tools like Alteryx and Tableau.
Develop and Enhance Data Science Skill Sets: You should be comfortable developing algorithms, mathematical models and cognitive capabilities that interact with other software and analytical components that run autonomously with minimal human supervision. We expect you to have a solid foundation developing Machine Learning algorithms and Data Science models which to build upon over the course of the internship.
Build Strong Partnerships: We are striving to integrate advanced analytics into our everyday culture. You will be asked to work with the business / domain experts to understand what they want to solve. Then, apply data science capabilities to help us overcome the hardest challenges, breakdown the data silos, connect the disparate parts and champion the data-driven culture.
The Art of Data Science: You can be the best data scientist, but if you cannot communicate your research no one may ever know. Data storytelling will be part of your internship experience. You should expect to assemble the data science tools and models and apply them to data to answer the relevant questions – and communicate that answer in a way a non-data scientist will understand. A proactive, creative, curious mind-set and a desire to influence your own development will go a long way.
Data Science Internship Responsibilities
Identify the data and advanced analytics needs to address the project challenges, define the appropriate solution and deploy the advanced analytics models to deliver results
Drive the collection of new data and the refinement of existing data sources

The Mars Petcare Segment consists of five Divisions: Pet Nutrition, Royal Canin, Mars Veterinary Health N. America, Mars Veterinary Health International & Diagnostics, and Kinship. Under this new organization of Petcare Product and Service brands, we launched our data strategy in 2018 with an objective to ""Create a Better World for Pets by extending global leadership in Nutrition, Health and Services powered by data"".

With the breadth and scale of our Petcare businesses we have unique and unrivalled data assets. The potential to create benefits for pets and sustainable competitive advantage is huge and we need to seize this opportunity now.

Our data assets consist of a variety of sources: veterinary data including appointment and invoice details as well as the medical histories and diagnostic details this provides, breed and disease marker data from our DNA diagnostics business (Wisdom Health), location and activity tracking data from our Whistle business, and we have sales data, consumer data, and valuable information about retailers, veterinarians, breeders and shelters from our nutrition business. We also have third party data providing us with product purchasing insights and the potential to develop deeper and broader views into Petcare shopping through collaboration and D2C engagement.

MARS VETERINARY HEALTH & DIAGNOSTICS: POWERED BY DATA

A division of the Petcare Group, Mars Veterinary Health and Diagnostics is a purpose led, mission drive business that generates more than $7 billion in annual revenue, with more than 65,000 associates, +2,500 animal hospitals around the world and the largest network of veterinary labs in North America. We operate a family of veterinary businesses – Banfield, VCA, BluePearl, AniCura, and Linnaeus and one focused on veterinary diagnostics -Antech-.

At Antech we are using artificial intelligence to disrupt diagnostics. In the past six months we have launched ground-breaking, innovative technologies such as RenalTech®, which is able to predict chronic kidney disease in cats up to two years before it's diagnosed as well as the first non-invasive diagnostic for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, which will help dogs recover faster by giving veterinarians an easy way to diagnose or rule out this complex disease. This focus on innovation and a clear strategy to accelerate international expansion is an unmatched opportunity to define the future of pet health.

(“Talaris”) is developing a breakthrough, one-time cell therapy to enable patients who receive a living donor kidney transplant to no longer require lifelong immunosuppression, without rejecting their donated organ. Achieving durable, drug-free immune tolerance to a donated organ has been referred to as a “Holy Grail” of organ transplant. In a ground-breaking, phase 2 study conducted between 2008 - 2016, our lead therapy, FCR001, enabled 70% of patients to be weaned off all immunosuppression within 12 months of their kidney transplant. No tolerized patient has had to resume immunosuppression. We have followed these patients for an average of almost five years since their transplant, and the longest for over ten years. Our single-dose cell therapy has also shown the potential to induce durable remission of certain types of severe auto-immune diseases, and to benefit other solid organ transplant patients.

Our goal is to help people save money, and we believe the best way to do that is by giving them a way to shop for loans and compare lenders so they make their best financial choices.

Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.

We're a publicly-traded company (TREE).We've welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.We've built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.We still make funny commercials ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX43xCZV5j0 ).

639,"About Go

We're building the world’s first Social Life platform; it’s called Go. Use it to plan some binge-watching of a Netflix series with a buddy, have a potluck with your close friends, plan a great night out with a date, see a concert, make it on time for the best happy hour you never knew about with old friends, or find and enroll in a nearby yoga (or boxing, or rock climbing…) class that fits perfectly in your schedule. If you’re feeling adventurous, check out a list of the best stuff happening in your city that you love or are visiting, or explore new activities that you’ve always wanted to experience but don’t know where to start (and don’t have time and motivation to research it all on the internet).

All of that ‘stuff’, well, it’s what makes our worlds go-round; because that’s what life is about. Friends. Family. Community. Love. Adventure. So, instead of staring down at a smartphone at all hours of the day opining on things that your community has already done. Go creates a world where every post on your feed is something you can actually go and do. A platform that helps you plan and coordinate and get out there. Off the screen and into the fray of real life. That’s Go.

We’re not gonna lie: Go is early-stage. But we’re funded, led by an incredible, passionate, and prestigious team, and have a product that very well may make the world a better place. We’re not Uber for cats, or some weird new drink or delivery service. We’re attempting to solve the monumental problem of social rift. We believe that a path back from a post-fact, post-community world is one that starts with a cup of coffee with an old friend. Or a bike ride. Any time you’re off you’re social media feeds and hanging out with others. A technology company devoted to making life better through empowering people to build and enrich real-life relationships with friends, family, and community.

Go is founded on the belief that a healthy social life is fundamentally made up of two things: spending time with people and doing the things that you want to do. It’s that simple: People should do what they love and be free to live the best life possible. Social technology should help us in real life by promoting human agency and self-actualization, and must stand against exploitation and the monetisation of its users and their personal data. Our world and environment has untapped and unknown richness, beauty and potential. Happiness is contagious whether found through extraordinary events or shared simple and mundane experiences. Tech can help happiness grow and make life better - in the real world.

826,"WHO WE LOOK FOR

An SEI Consultant is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI consultants keenly understand how to adjust their approach based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, our consultants possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

As super-connectors, our consultants connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI Consultants frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI Consultants are ethical and trustworthy individuals who do what they say. SEI Consultants have an insatiable curiosity and love to learn. These individuals are commonly tech savvy and early adopters. Their passion for learning is infectious and excites others.

As every project is different, an SEI Consultant must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. An SEI Consultant must be at ease with ambiguity because although a client knows that a problem exists – they need SEI to figure it out and drive a solution. SEI Consultants define ambition differently. SEI Consultants are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who like to hang out with colleagues outside of work. Whether it be cooking, traveling, hiking, or volunteering, SEI Consultants enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends and family.

WHAT WE DO

Our consultants work with clients at all levels of the organization, from the C-suite to the shop floor, helping them to deliver on their most strategic initiatives. We’re known for making realistic, data-driven decisions that deliver value in tangible ways to our clients.

Deloitte Transactions and Business Analytics LLP (DTBA) advises clients on managing business controversy and conflict, executing deals, and maintaining regulatory compliance. We provide services to companies throughout their lifecycle from purchasing a company to investigating potential fraud.

AML Analytics is a fast-growth practice within Deloitte Regulatory that centers around several of the hottest areas of business today – analytics, forensic analysis, and litigation support – and the specialized skills that make careers in these areas both fascinating and in high-demand. Our Analytics team makes extensive use of data, statistical and quantitative analysis, rules-based methods, and explanatory and predictive modeling to bring insights to client issues in the forensic and transaction domains. We work with Deloitte specialists in many areas, and we apply our solutions to a wide range of highly interesting and complex corporate events, such as forensic investigations, anti-corruption compliance, restructuring, valuation, anti-money laundering compliance, and construction management, to explain what has occurred in the past and to support informed decision making for the future. Our work increasingly employs specialized competencies, such as advanced analytics, visualization, and geospatial techniques.

Data Analytics:
Data Analytics: This involves strategic analysis of structured (e.g. transactional) and unstructured (e.g. text) electronic data, from initial data scoping and collection through transformation and validation, for purposes of deep data analysis and mining. This analysis is performed as the basis for larger efforts that include rules- and indicator-based testing, inductive reasoning, and visualization techniques. These methods are used to identify, deter, and prevent fraud schemes and scenarios, develop models that depict or describe historical events, and build predictive models for future anti-fraud and anti-corruption efforts. Analytical methods are also commonly used to mine and develop insights into large volumes of data to help navigate intricate legal processes and identify areas of opportunity for business process improvement. Additionally, analytics is often used to assist troubled companies in peer analysis, quantifying opportunity cost, and discerning areas of strategic improvement.
Application Development: From standalone tools to enterprise web applications, we leverage a modern proprietary services-based development platform and agile methodology to assist clients with processing data, presenting findings, and documenting decisions. We serve both external clients and internal clients with a focus on enhancing existing products and service offerings

Examples of areas in which AML Analytics has delivered value to clients include:
Enhancing a transaction-monitoring program for a financial services client by assisting them in the development of a methodology to analyze, test, and tune various detection scenarios, and assisting them in deploying that methodology.
Delivering an analytics solution that created a predictive coding model to assist a financial services client with identifying and categorizing an enormous volume of privileged and non- privileged documents related to a large bankruptcy case.
Helping to resolve a royalty distribution dispute in the client's favor by developing and articulating an economic model that showed how to determine the relative market value of the copyrighted content.
Our dedicated Deloitte professionals bring vast experience, specialized skill sets and deep industry knowledge to our clients. This personalized level of service, combined with the market reach and technical resources of the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited (DTTL) member firms and their affiliates, enables us to respond to the complex and diverse needs of our clients around the world.

1230,"Division:HSE - E3/Sentinel’s Homeland Security Enterprise (HSE) division is an integrated organizational entity fostering increased collaboration and synergies across the Homeland domain. HSE combines the skills and talents of over 245 (and growing) E3S employees and subcontractor staff supporting multiple components across DHS, including but not limited to: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office (CWMD), Federal Protective Services (FPS), and the DHS Headquarters Management Directorate. Our team provides rapid, innovative and specialized solutions that enable our HSE clients to success at meeting dynamic mission objectives.Position Overview:

Each day U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) oversees the massive flow of people, capital, and products that enter and depart the United States via air, land, sea, and cyberspace. The volume and complexity of both physical and virtual border crossings requires the application of “big data” solutions to promote efficient trade and travel.

Through the use of effective “big data” technologies and solutions, CBP ensures that the movement of people, capital, and products is legal, safe, and secure. In response to this challenge, ManTech, as a trusted mission partner of CBP, seeks capable, qualified and versatile data analysts to facilitate data-driven decision making in response to national security threats.

The primary objective of the data analysis team is three-fold: 1) Support the development of predictive models via the identification of behaviors and attributes that inform illicit activities; 2) Provide on-demand analysis to support emergent operational needs; and, 3) Develop performance dashboards and artifacts to inform resource allocation, justify requirements, and support statutory reporting mandates.

In all three areas, data analysts must be capable of transforming large volumes of raw data, both structured and unstructured forms, into mission-focused insights that enhance understanding of mission performance, workload, and/or behavioral trends (i.e., strategic, tactical, and operational insights). Analysts may be called upon to support a diverse array of initiatives involving complex queries in support of network analysis, entity resolution, threat research, visualization, and impact assessments.

Responsibilities:
The strongest applicants will engage in highly dynamic, threat/risk driven operating environments. They will bring a proven track record of working with decision support tools and applications operationally employed by mission-support entities. Within three to six months of joining the project, we expect analysts will:

Master relevant data schemas, reference data, joining conditions, and relationships of existing databases, as well as associated warehouses and data marts, involving trade, travel, national security, and law enforcement data.
Conduct exploratory analysis demonstrating: a refined understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the underlying data; a willingness to explore non-traditional data sources and evaluation methods; and a clear link to mission need.
Construct query code as well as run, save, edit, optimize, and document queries using SQL and other languages including Spark to extract mission-critical insights.
Design, develop and deliver analytic artifacts such as dashboards, scorecards, and structured Excel reports that: support executive-level, at-a-glance findings; empower non-technical users to explore user-specific equities (e.g. PowerBI); and/or provide detailed information informing operational outcomes.
Assess validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity of data as well as develop mitigation steps and processes to address data quality issues in support of clean data.
Translate findings (e.g. mission impacts, limitations of findings/ analytical confidence, analytical methods and techniques employed) to clearly articulate the “so what” within the context of mission performance to technical and non-technical audiences in the form of written reports and in-person briefings.
Engage internal and external stakeholders in a professional and informed manner to collect analysis requirements and ensure alignment of expected outcomes.
Integrate with, and materially contribute to, portfolio teams as a matrixed resource to provide data analytics expertise in support of modeling, ad hoc query support, or performance assessment initiatives in collaboration with data scientists, intelligence analysts, developers, and other participants under the direction of a project manager.

Applicants should note that while some formal training exists to support building knowledge of missions and the implementation of data-driven solutions, but much of the knowledge must be gained through on-the-job training and individual initiative. Technical knowledge is insufficient to achieve effectiveness in this operating environment; expertise must be enhanced with rapid acquisition of mission knowledge and demonstrated commitment positive mission outcomes. Therefore, we seek self-starters who are capable of independent exploration and knowledge acquisition, willing to develop informal support networks, and with an appreciation for the immense challenge of safeguarding the Nation’s borders.

Required Qualifications:
BS Degree in a related technical fields (Computer Science, Math, Statistics, etc.)
Hands on experience working with data-mining, analysis or statistical software such as R, Matlab, SAS Enterprise Miner, SPSS Modeler, or SQL Developer for data analysis
Hands on experience with at least one of the following technologies: Hadoop eco system, including HDFS, YARN, Cassandra, Hive, Pig, and Spark
Hands on experience with Batch-oriented and streaming distributed processing methods such as Nifi, Spark, Kafka, or Storm
Hands on experience with distributed search engines like Elasticsearch or Solr
Conceptual understanding of – and/or prior experiences related to – data profiling, fuzzy matching, entity resolution, and signal detection theory (specifically with respect to SD theory: designing and improving upon systems that monitor, minimize, and balance false positive and false negative outcomes)
Completed CBP Background Investigation clearance (active or re-instate-able)

Preferred Qualifications:
Experience with programming languages such as Java, Python, and SQL
Unix / Linux experience
Experience working in field of entity resolution, analytics, data mining or name matching.
Delivering solutions using Amazon Web Services (e.g., AWS EC2, RDS, S3)
